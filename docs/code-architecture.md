# Code Architecture

This project is bootstrapped using [remix run's](https://remix.run/) CLI.
Remix is a fullstack reactjs based web framework.


## Technology Stack
**Frontend**
- [ReactJS](https://beta.reactjs.org/) for the templating/ui rendering language

**Backend**
- Under the hood this uses nodeJS server (abstracted by `remix-run`).

**Frontend & Backend**
- both the frontend and backend use `remix-run`
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is used for both the language on the frontend & backend of this app.

## Hosting
- code is hosted on [vercel](https://vercel.com/)


## Folders
- `/api`
  - generated by `remix-run`
  - ....
- `/app`
  - generated by `remix-run`.
  - This is where the application code lives. Both the frontend and backend live in this folder. `remix-run` may be unlike any other framework you've used, where you might have a server running with some endpoints and then the frontend code living separately making API calls to the server. Remix abstracts this for you. Our server and clientside code is co-located and its really awesome.
- `/docs`
  - place to put any general documentation or indepth explanations of things.
- `/public`
  - generated by `remix-run`. You will typically never interact with this folder. This is where Remix outputs the production of this code.
- `/scripts`
  - general scripts to run, typically things for starting up the project, checking user's enviornment deploying or building code.


## General Thoughts
- This website is simple in nature, and is mostly a static static data site. All the data (list of resources, links etc) are stored on the server; currently there is no database; at this time there isn't a need for one, but perhaps later it might make sense to add one.
- All content is server side rendered


## FAQ
**Why is this website server side rendered?**
- This website fortunately, is not a complicated single page application and is quite static in nature.
- Search Engine Optimization & page speed are important part of this resource, which all influence search engine discoverability, ranking, and usability. The topic of SEO is huge, but this is explanation is a simple explanation.
- `remix-run` makes server side rendering (SSR) very simple. In the past, such as setup would have been a pain to setup & manage & we likely would have just made a very light client side rendered (CSR) web application, since modern search engine bots can parse javascript.

**Why are not using Docker?**
- Docker is a great tool for creating fully reproducible code environments on any developer's machine. For the purposes of this project, docker adds more complexity; we make the assumption that most contributors are familiar with the NodeJS ecosystem (npm) and thus installing & running the code *should* be simple.
- This website is fairly static; for example since the data does not change very often, it can be simply stored in a JSON file or array in memory on the server. User's will eventually be able to sumbit resources through a form, which will be briefly reviewed for quaility purposes & then be added to the data (JSON file or list in the backend).
