# Code Architecture

This project is bootstrapped using [remix run's](https://remix.run/) CLI.
Remix is a fullstack reactjs based web framework.

## Technology Stack

**Frontend**

- [ReactJS](https://beta.reactjs.org/) for the templating/ui rendering language

**Backend**

- Under the hood this uses nodeJS server (abstracted by `remix-run`).

**Frontend & Backend**

- both the frontend and backend use `remix-run`
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is used for both the language on the frontend & backend of this app.

## Hosting

- code is hosted on [vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Folders

- `/api`
  - generated by `remix-run`
  - ....
- `/app`
  - generated by `remix-run`.
  - This is where the application code lives. Both the frontend and backend live in this folder. `remix-run` may be unlike any other framework you've used, where you might have a server running with some endpoints and then the frontend code living separately making API calls to the server. Remix abstracts this for you. Our server and clientside code is co-located and its really awesome.
- `/docs`
  - place to put any general documentation or indepth explanations of things.
- `/public`
  - generated by `remix-run`. You will typically never interact with this folder. This is where Remix outputs the production of this code.
- `/scripts`
  - general scripts to run, typically things for starting up the project, checking user's enviornment deploying or building code.

## General Thoughts

- This website is simple in nature, and is mostly a static static data site; we use cache headers to simulate a static website.
- All content is server side rendered, which is nice for SEO and we get for free using Remix without thinking about it.
