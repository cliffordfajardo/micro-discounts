        created this website because they noticed{" "}
        <b>there wasn't an easy, simple centralized place to discover discounts online.</b> Whether you're a student in
        college seeking a laptop or backpack discount, a teacher needing a software discount to teach her class or just
        a hobbyist trying out a new service out, our aim is to empower you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most other discount websites are crowded with unhelpful ads and content distracting you from easily finding that
        discount you need. We are different. Our aim is to be simple and easy to use.
